            <img src="images/IMG_5088.jpeg" alt="sibling photo" width="800" height="500">
            <p>I grew up being the only girl and youngest out of my brothers and I. I always say growing up around boys made me a tomboy due to the fact they owned monster trucks and not barbies. If I wanted to play I had to adapt to the boy culture. Howver I will not trade my childhood for anything. There were good and tough moments but my brothers and I always and still stick together.</p>
